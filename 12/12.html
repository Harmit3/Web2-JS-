    <script>

        //alert ----------> we can use it while wanna say on any click button and go ahead
        alert("Are you sure you wanna go ahead?");  




        //prompt ----------> it is type of alert but you can take input inside it
        //                   also put default values inside that    prompt("What's you name?",'Harmit');     
        prompt("What's you name?",'Harmit');     
        //                   you can store this value in variable and do experiment in this. Fo eg:- we print the input value on the console
        const hello= prompt("What's you name?");   
        console.log(hello);



        // There are two objects avaible in DOM avaible at window level.

        // 1. Window Object   ----> which is browser's window where we can show out html code
        //                    ----> This is useful when we need to do when user reload page first time do this,second time do this etc.
        //                    ----> has global scope
        console.log(window);  //you can see the object window in the console 


        //console.log("Harmit"); is actually window.console.log("Harmit") will give same output because  by default it is a window and we see js output under window
        //so anything happens on window is under window. like prompt,alert is window.prompt() or window.alert()
        console.log("Harmit") 
        window.console.log("Harmit");






        //2.document  ----->  is object availble under window object
        //          ----->  window.document and console.log(window.document); both are same which will return out document's code under console
        //          ----->  in js, whatever you write is avaible in document object
        //          -----> document.tile is window.document.title
        window.document;
        console.log(window.document);
        //          ----->  so for eg. if you wanna access anything from out code you can get it by document and also manipulate it
        console.log(document.title);  //will print title
        document.title="ABCD";        //when compiler came here then title change on DOM, otherwise it will remain same
        console.log(document.title);  //will print ABCD now. and also seen under document if we do console.log

        console.log(document.body);  //will print the body of our document

        document.write("This is hacked.");  //will print on DOM


        // for eg:- you can take inut from user and write on DOM
        const name=prompt("What's your good name?");
        document.write("Hello "+name);
